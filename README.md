> Zero-dependency, single-file web tool that scores how human-looking a pointer/touch interaction is — and tells you which specific signals gave it away.

## What it does

Every click, long-press, or swipe on the test pad is analyzed in real time across ~30 signals that click-fraud and anti-bot systems actually look at:

| Category              | Signals                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Event trust           | `isTrusted`, pointer/touch source, `navigator.webdriver`                |
| Pressure              | min / max / avg / stddev, change count, Force Touch                     |
| Contact geometry      | `radiusX`, `radiusY`, `rotationAngle`, width × height                   |
| Trajectory            | straightness, path efficiency, curvature, jitter, Bezier-match          |
| Time profile          | duration, sample interval avg/stddev, pauses                            |
| Advanced              | entropy, angle stddev, speed consistency, coordinate decimal precision  |
| Environment           | WebDriver, HeadlessChrome, Selenium markers, UA / touch mismatch, etc.  |

The output is a **0–100 risk score** (higher = more human-like) plus a list of exactly which rules fired, shown directly on the page.

## Usage
